# Odoo Confirm ðŸ˜º
A minimal Chrome extension to make sure you don't accidentally "Send Message" instead of "Log Note".

Supports Odoo 17.0+

## How to use?
When the extension is installed & active, the following confirmation dialog will pop up whenever you send a message:

## Development
Develop on the custom Odoo module `odoo_confirm_module`.
Then "build" by pasting the compiled Owl code from `web.assets_web.js` into `content.js` to be run by the Chrome extension.

Improvements / fixes / PR's welcome :)
